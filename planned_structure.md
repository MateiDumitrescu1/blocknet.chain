# Components of blockchains in general  
## Block
## Blockchain
The blockchain is essentially a list (or chain) of blocks. It manages:  
Chain Integrity: Ensuring blocks are linked correctly.   
Consensus Mechanism: Agreeing on the current state among nodes.   
Adding New Blocks: Validating and appending new blocks.   
## Node
## P2P Network  
## Consensus Algorithm  
A consensus algorithm ensures all nodes agree on the blockchain's state.  
Ensures: secure and transparent transaction recording 
Ensures: transactions added to blockchain are legitimate

#### Proof of Work (PoW)
Requires network participants to solve computational problem, requiring a lot of compute. Reward: participants gets to add the next block to the chain and gets some ammount of currency
#### Proof of Stake (PoS)
Aims to solve the energy consumption and compute problems of PoW.  
Network participants are required to stake a certain amount of cryptocurency in the network. Then the network randomly selects a participants (called a validator) to validate the new block, collect some fees from the transactions of that block or some native tokens of the network they validate. This way, **validators** are rewarded for the helping the consensus of the network.    

By receiving rewards, **validators** are incentivized to act honestly and in the network's best interest. Any malicious behavior or negligence may result in penalties, slashing of rewards, or loss of their stake.  
**Validators** are crucial to PoS. Becoming a **validator** means meeting certain requirements (like minimum amount of coins staked). Once selected, **validators** perform tasks such as verifying transactions, checking the validity of blocks, and proposing new blocks for inclusion in the blockchain.   
How proposing new blocks works: every 10s (for example), the chosen **validator** selects pending transactions in the transaction pool (sometimes called **mempool**) and organizez them into a block. The **validator** then broadcasts the block to the network.  


#### Dedicated Proof of State (DPoS)

Network users vote and elect **delegates** to validate the next block.  
Users vote for a certain **delegate** by pooling their tokens into a staking pool and linking those the delegate. The delegate with the most tokens may then validate a block, and receive the corresponding transaction fees as a reward. Next, the delegate distributes the rewards to users who supported them based on each userâ€™s stake.  

Users can also vote out delegates if they make malicious attempts on the network. As such, delegates with a strong reputation are usually elected as witnesses.
