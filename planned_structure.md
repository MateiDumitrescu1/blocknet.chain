# Components of blockchains in general  
### Block
### Blockchain
The blockchain is essentially a list (or chain) of blocks. It manages:  
Chain Integrity: Ensuring blocks are linked correctly.   
Consensus Mechanism: Agreeing on the current state among nodes.   
Adding New Blocks: Validating and appending new blocks.   
### Node
### P2P Network  
### Consensus Algorithm  
A consensus algorithm ensures all nodes agree on the blockchain's state.
